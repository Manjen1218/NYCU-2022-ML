# NYCU-2022-ML
This is my final project in the course, Introduction to Machine Learning in NYCU.
## Introduction
I do my Logistic Regression model by below steps.
1. Feature extraction to prevent overfitting
2. Impute data by using  Huber Regression and KNNImputer
3. Scaling feature with StandardScaler()
4. Pre-trained Logistic Regression model
5. Predection and submission
